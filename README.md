# Grocery Shopping
This project is based on the danish concept "MÃ¥ltidskasser" which is boxes you can buy each week where you get 2-5 recipies and food delivered. 

The scope of this project is to create a tool where you choose a reciepe and the algorithm automatically finds the products for that reciepe and puts it in the basket for you. Ready to order :D
